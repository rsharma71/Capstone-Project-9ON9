# Capstone-Project-9ON9
working Code on 9On9 

Open the project in VS code then open the terminal. Enter the main folder by typing <code>cd FolderName</code> then type <code>npm install</code>. then to initiate the project type <code>npm start</code>.
Install Expo framework in your Ios mobile from App store. Scan the Qr code provided by the terminal open it in the Expo FrameWork and the application will be loaded.

The application does not work properly yet but the reset button works and also the scores are added to both the sides, I have to figure out yet that the scores get added to one side when clicked on the green side and same as the blue one.
